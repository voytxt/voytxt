Hi there! I'm a 19-year-old student from [Czechia](https://voytxt.com/czechia), soon to be studying CompSci at [Masaryk University](https://www.muni.cz/en/admissions/bachelors-and-masters-studies) in [Brno](https://necyklopedie.org/wiki/Brno). I've always liked [pressing buttons](https://xkcd.com/722/) and tried to [do my best](https://aaronfrancis.com/2024/what-if-you-tried-hard-dac139a5), whenever I could. I spent my high school years competing in various contests, ranging from formal math and programming to the very creative [code golf](https://code.golf/golfers/voytxt) problems.

I know frontend the best, but I've been dabbling with backend and systems programming as well. Some of my most ambitious projects are (in no particular order):

- Automated bot for a vocabulary learning platform our high school forced us to do.
- Discord Bot development, mainly centered around games I liked at the time, e.g. Geometry Dash and Minecraft.
- [Pickle Hunt](https://picklehunt.voytxt.com/), a site for analyzing achievements on the Hypixel Minecraft server.
- [WCA Bluesky bot](https://bsky.app/profile/wca.voytxt.com), which posts the latest Rubik's Cube World & Continental records.
- [Chess](https://chess.voytxt.com/), completely written in the Gleam programming language.
- Discord bio changer. I had a my Discord bio automatically update with the latest statistics from TETR.IO.
- An Instagram bot that posted name days (_svátky_ in Czechia) for each day, with a random photo in the background, as well as stats about the name.
- Each year since 2022, I've also been doing [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) in TypeScript, and as of 2025 in Gleam as well.

You can contact me via Discord `@voytxt`, or e-mail (my username @ voytxt.com).
